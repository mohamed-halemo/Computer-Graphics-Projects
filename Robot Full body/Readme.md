###I took 7 screen shots showing the robot in differnt positions and angles
``````````````````````````````````````````
###problems faced: it was at first understanding that i should make the blank place and give it it's size inorder to draw the stuff inside it with a smaller size and also searching for drawing cube right and sphere
``````````````````````````````````````````
Explination of the process:
1)the first matrix contains the body as a whole and we pop it down after pushing the rest of the things.
2)we then push the head in a matrix in it's place and with it's size then pop
3)we do the same for the body but we draw cube
4)we then push for the left arm as a whole and putting it's coordinates and some rotations and then we push each part of the arm as a 2 cubes with another push and pop one for each then we draw fingers && Repeat for Right arm
5)for the leg it's similar to arm but no fingers instead of fingers with push a glutsolid cube // repeat for both legs
6)Angles variables added and defined angles of rotations and did manage them same as in fingers

Thanks!!
